# Implemented my code in C++ programming language and the code flow is discussed as follow:  
step 1: In main function we took inputs from user  N as number of cities ,h as number of hotspots,x as maximum distance and all the roads connected as edges.\
step 2: We applied the all pair shortest path algorithm.\
step 3: From the hotspots nodes we find the cities which are visited by more than one hotspot cities having shortest path less than or equal to the given maximum distance x.\
step 4: We  using hash map and count all the nodes from step 3 and printed as the output.\
# Time complexity of our code is O(N^3).
